If you want to add multiple languages to your Cockpit backend you can simply copy the i18n language files [from this Repository](https://github.com/agentejo/cockpit-i18n) to `/config/cockpit/i18n`. After that you will be able to change the language of Cockpit users in the user management.

When the folder `/config/cockpit/i18n` is missing, just create it. Keep in mind to keep webserver permissions for those folders.
